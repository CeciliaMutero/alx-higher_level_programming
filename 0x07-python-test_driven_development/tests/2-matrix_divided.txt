def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
    """
    Divide all elements of a matrix by a divisor.

    Parameters:
    - matrix (list of lists): The matrix to be divided.
    - div (int or float): The divisor to divide each element of the matrix by

    Returns:
    list of lists: A new matrix with elements divided by the divisor.

    Raises:
    TypeError: If the matrix is not a list of lists or if the divisor is not an int or float.
    ValueError: If the rows of the matrix are not of the same size.
    ZeroDivisionError: If the divisor is 0.
